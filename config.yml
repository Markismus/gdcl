# ==GoldenDict Command-Line Version (gdcl) Configuration File==
#
# By default, gdcl will look for this file in the config folder under the
# user's home directory (~/.config/gdcl/) or in the $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS 
# (/etc/xdg/gdcl). If it can't find a file named config.yml in these default 
# location, it will look for it in the current working directory. If 
# config.yml cannot be found in any of the above locations, the program will 
# abort with an error message explaining the situation.
